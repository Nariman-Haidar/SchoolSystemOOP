we are going to repeat OOP and then I want to find a way to leverage the strengths of the different OOP concepts

Login

Show control comma with inheritance, poly, abstract with different user roles

you enter username and password

the person who logs in determines what kind of user object is created role in the user superclass and we need users in some kind of database with that role: from the method, based on the user, an admin object is returned, for example

step 1:

enable logging in as a user with the admin role USER, ADMIN and a method to log in

USER:
superclass
username (email)
password

ADMIN:
